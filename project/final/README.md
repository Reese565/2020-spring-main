# W266 Final Project Submission
## Paper
You can read our final paper:
https://github.com/datasci-w266/2020-spring-assignment-rocassius/blob/project/project/SpeechPolarization_Cassius%26Williams.pdf
Note: Unfortunately, we were unable to keep our page count under the 6 page limit. This is because our project is highly interdisciplinary; it involved building a highly customized Deep Neural Network, and then applying it to a substantial analysis task. As such, we feel that our breach of the page limit was something we could not help. we respectfully ask you to be forgiving of this.
Enjoy!
